/**
 * Business Logic Service for DEPLOYMENT operations.
 * 
 * PURPOSE: Manages vehicle movements between locations/branches.
 * Handles fleet rebalancing and vehicle transfers.
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES:
 * - DeploymentDAO (deployment records)
 * - VehicleDAO (update vehicle location, check status)
 * - LocationDAO (validate locations)
 * 
 * METHODS TO IMPLEMENT:
 * 
 * 1. deployVehicle(int vehicleId, int fromLocationId, int toLocationId, String reason, String driverName)
 *    WORKFLOW:
 *    - Verify vehicle exists and is available (VehicleDAO)
 *    - Verify both locations exist (LocationDAO)
 *    - Create deployment record with status "In Transit" (DeploymentDAO)
 *    - Optionally update vehicle status to "In Transit"
 *    - Return deployment ID
 * 
 * 2. completeDeployment(int deploymentId, Timestamp arrivalDate)
 *    WORKFLOW:
 *    - Get deployment record (DeploymentDAO)
 *    - Update deployment with arrival date and status "Completed"
 *    - Update vehicle's locationId to destination (VehicleDAO)
 *    - Update vehicle status back to "Available"
 * 
 * 3. cancelDeployment(int deploymentId)
 *    - Mark deployment as "Cancelled"
 *    - Ensure vehicle location is correct
 * 
 * 4. getVehicleDeploymentHistory(int vehicleId)
 *    - Get all deployments for a vehicle
 *    - Track vehicle movement history
 * 
 * 5. getActiveDeployments()
 *    - Get all deployments currently in transit
 *    - For fleet tracking
 * 
 * 6. getDeploymentsByLocation(int locationId)
 *    - Get deployments to/from a specific location
 *    - For location management
 * 
 * 7. suggestRebalancing()
 *    - Analyze vehicle distribution across locations
 *    - Suggest which vehicles to move where
 *    - Based on rental frequency and availability
 * 
 * COLLABORATOR NOTES:
 * - Update vehicle location when deployment completes
 * - Ensure vehicle is available before deploying
 * - Track deployment reasons for analytics
 * - Use in location rental frequency reports
